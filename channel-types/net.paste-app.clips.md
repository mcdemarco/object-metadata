<!-- provide a description for this channel type's behavior -->
This channel type provides clip storage for Paste.  Clips are stored in the annotations of a public message.

Paste channels can be read by anyone but only written to by a single user.  Readers should have public set to true.

Most messages have automatically-generated text with the real content in an annotation (net.paste-app.clip). Clients should render the annotation of such messages.

Paste channels do not have a canonical URL; the user's channel(s) are detected on authentication at paste-app.net.
